## Database Schema

The web app uses the same Supabase database as the Flutter app:

- **app_users**: User accounts with roles
- **perfumes**: Perfume inventory with cost, sell, and store prices
- **orders**: Customer orders
- **order_items**: Items within orders

## Authentication

The app supports three user roles:

- **Admin**: Full access to all features
- **Manager**: Can manage inventory and view reports
- **Staff**: Can view inventory and process orders

## Features Comparison with Mobile App

| Feature | Mobile App | Web App |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Authentication | âœ… | âœ… |
| Inventory View | âœ… | âœ… |
| Add/Edit Products | âœ… | ðŸ”„ (Coming Soon) |
| Orders Management | âœ… | ðŸ”„ (Coming Soon) |

## Development

### Adding New Features

1. Create components in `src/components/`
2. Add types to `src/lib/supabase.ts`
3. Update the dashboard or create new pages
4. Test with different user roles

### Styling

The app uses Tailwind CSS with a custom design system. Colors and components are defined in `tailwind.config.js`.

### State Management

Authentication state is managed using React Context (`AuthContext`). For more complex state, consider adding Redux Toolkit or Zustand.

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Deploy automatically

### Netlify

1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Upload the `dist` folder to Netlify

### Self-hosted

1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Serve the `dist` folder with any static file server

## Environment Variables

The Supabase configuration is currently hardcoded in `src/lib/supabase.ts`. For production, consider using environment variables:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```
